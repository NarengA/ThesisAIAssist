
Build an MVP “Thesis Management System with AI Assistant” using the following exact instructions. Follow them step-by-step and generate all necessary files.


---

1) Tech Stack (Fixed – Do NOT change)

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Frontend: React (Vite)

Database: SQLite for MVP

AI: OpenAI Chat Completions API

Auth: JWT + role-based access (Student, Supervisor, Admin)



---

2) Features (MVP Only)

Student:

Upload files (with versioning)

Track thesis phases

Chat with AI assistant

Dashboard: phases, deadlines, supervisor feedback


Supervisor:

View student dashboard

Approve/reject phases

Comment on files

See file history


Admin:

Manage users & projects (simple CRUD)


AI Assistant:

/chat → takes user message, returns AI answer

Provides: research help, step-by-step guidance, reminders

3) Backend Tasks (FastAPI)

Create the following structure:

backend/
  main.py
  db.py
  auth.py
  models.py
  routes/
    projects.py
    phases.py
    files.py
    comments.py
    reminders.py
    chat.py
  utils/
    jwt.py
    hashing.py

Database Models

User(id, name, email, password_hash, role)

Project(id, title, student_id, supervisor_id, status)

Phase(id, project_id, name, status, due_date)

File(id, project_id, phase_id, filename, created_at)

FileVersion(id, file_id, version_number, hash, uploaded_at)

Comment(id, project_id, phase_id, author_id, content)

Reminder(id, user_id, project_id, message, due_date, status)


Required API Endpoints

POST /auth/register

POST /auth/login

GET /projects

POST /projects

GET /projects/{projectId}/phases

POST /projects/{projectId}/phases

GET /projects/{projectId}/files

POST /projects/{projectId}/files (upload)

POST /projects/{projectId}/phases/{phaseId}/update-status

POST /projects/{projectId}/comments

POST /projects/{projectId}/reminders

POST /chat


/chat Endpoint Details

Input: { "message": "string", "userId": number }

Output: { "reply": "string" }

Use gpt-4o-mini (or best available)

4) Frontend Tasks (React)

Create frontend/ with:

src/
  pages/
    Login.jsx

    DashboardSupervisor.jsx
  components/
    FileUpload.jsx
    PhaseList.jsx
    ChatBox.jsx
    FileHistory.jsx
  api/
    client.js

Frontend must include:

Login page

Student dashboard: phases, reminders, files, AI chatbox

5) Project Root Structure

/backend
/frontend
.env.example
README.md
.gitignore


---

6) Environment Variables (.env)

7) What You (Replit) Must Produce

✔ Full folder structure
✔ All backend files with real code
✔ Database initialization
✔ JWT login + register working

8) Final Requirement

Generate all files automatically

Do not skip or summarize

Code must be executable immediately on Replit
